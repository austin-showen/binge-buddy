### **_About the App_**

#### Binge Buddy is a web application designed to help users track and journal their progress as they watch their favorite TV shows. Using data from TheMovieDB's API, Binge Buddy allows users to search for shows and add them to their personal watch lists. Users can then access details on individual episodes, mark them as Watched or Watch Later, rate them, and leave comments or reviews.
